# opampmic
super simple phantom powered electret impedance converter and doug self style balanced output. As discrete JFETS are harder to come by, this circuit takes advantage of the FETS inside of a popular Op amp.

This PCB was designed to fit inside Zramo 104, and with the stock capsule, it sounds 1000 times better than the original mic. This PCB will also fit inside of MXL 603s type bodies. 

circuit designed by Jules Ryckebusch, PCB layout by me Chris Williams. I first saw this circuit here:

Jules has an alternate design that is impedance balanced, which is also worth a shot, as well as a version for true condensers.

I have had problems with this mic on some vintage style preamps, but on most modern chip based preamps, it performs well.
